A cornerstone embodies the essential and unshakeable element that holds a structure or idea together, providing a stable and reliable foundation upon which everything else relies.
I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic.

  119evl
